# CollaborativeFiltering-MovieRecommender
Implementation of a simple movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The model, built with TensorFlow, predicts movie ratings by learning user and movie features through gradient descent optimization. The project includes rating normalization to handle unrated movies and a regularized cost function to prevent overfitting."
